                As predominantly independent researchers, my focus when working with postdocs is in career
                development in addition to providing feedback on scientific writing, presentations, and research
                project(s).
                Whether your desired next career step is as a researcher, a lecturer, both, or neither (i.e., a career
                outside of academia) I am commited to passing along opportunities and supporting you in developing your
                job
                packet.
                Although I currently do not have any funding set aside for postdoctoral appointments; I am interested in
                collaborating with postdoc candidates to develop fellowship proposals. If you would like to work with
                me,
                please <a href="mailto:nawaz.muhammad@email.gwu.edu">reach out</a> and we can discuss further!

                PhD Students</h3>

                I am excited to mentor PhD students who are interested in understanding how humans are impacting the
                climate
                and air quality, and how we can use this knowledge to improve human and planetary health to progress
                towards
                a more sustainable and equitable future. During your research with me, you can anticipate learning how
                to
                simulate the atmosphere using high performance computing systems, explore how satellite observations of
                the
                atmosphere have relevance for air pollution, and quantify the health, equity, and economic costs
                associated with
                air
                pollution and climate change. As PhD students are both learning and conducting research, my priority is
                to mentor you in developing your scientific writing, presenting, and research skills and also
                help you tailor your PhD towards your desired career path. If you are interested in conducting
                full-time research at Cardiff
                University and working with me, please send me an <a
                    href="mailto:nawaz.muhammad@email.gwu.edu">email</a>! Further details about postgraduate research in
                the

                If you are interested in getting involved in research during your studies and to
                explore how

                be your first exposure to research, I aim to provide guidance on the basics of scientific research and
                writing. Specificially, I intend to support you
                in
                familiarizing yourself with high performance computing, working on data analysis and visualization, and
                developing
                your written and presentation scientific communication skills. Depending on your interests, you could
                learn
                about climate and atmospheric science, earth system modeling, remote
                sensing, data
                science, machine learning, or health and environmental justice research. I look forward to working with

                Fundamentally, I believe that scientific research benefits from being inclusive of diverse perspectives.
                Progress towards a more sustainable and equitable future can only be made
                through continued awareness of inequality and inequity. I want you to know that you are welcome in CASA
                and the larger scientific community. I am committed to creating an inclusive and
                respectful
                environment
