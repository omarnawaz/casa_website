I am an environmental scientist specialising in data science, atmospheric dispersion modelling, and GIS. My research focuses on quantifying emissions and evaluating their impacts on air quality and human health in data-constrained settings. I currently work with Dr. Omar Nawaz studying Mexico's Oil and Gas emissions.
